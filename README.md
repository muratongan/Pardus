Pardus SVN shapshot (2011)
==========================

This is a snapshot of the main repository of Pardus GNU/Linux operating system. The original SVN repository is currently down, so this serves as a backup.

I was the initial author of Pardus Migration Tool. It is a Python application with Qt GUI that is used to transfer user settings and files from Windows to Pardus. 

You can access [my initial version](trunk/playground/intern/2009/migration) of the code and the [latest version](trunk/kde/migration) in 2011.
