Pardus-2011-Svn-
================

This is a copy of the main repository of Pardus GNU/Linux operating system. The original SVN repository is currently down, so this serves as a backup.

I was the initial author of Pardus Migration Tool project, which you can find under /trunk/kde/migration. This application is used to transfer user settings and files from Windows to Pardus.
